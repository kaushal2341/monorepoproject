# CForm 

Form component made using react-bootstrap's form.

To use it, first

```jsx harmony
 import {CForm} from "@cogent/ui-components";
```
Then simply use it,

```jsx harmony
 let form = (<>
        <input type="text" required/>
        <CButton id="c-button-2" type="submit" name="Submit"/>
   </>);

 <CForm
      id="test"
      children={form}
      onSubmit={()=> {}}
 />
```
You can pass in the form components through children props and submit handler function through onSubmit props.
