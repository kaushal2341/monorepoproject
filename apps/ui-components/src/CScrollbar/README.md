    scrollToTop = () => {

                </p>
            </>);
        return (
            <CScrollbar
                _ref={c => { this.scrollbarsRef = c }}
                id="test"
                style={{height: 100}}
                className="abc"
                renderTrackVertical={props => <div {...props} className="track-vertical"/>}
                renderThumbVertical={props => <div {...props} className="thumb-vertical"/>}
                renderTrackHorizontal={props => <div {...props} className="track-horizontal"/>}
                renderThumbHorizontal={props => <div {...props} className="thumb-horizontal"/>}
                renderView={props => <div {...props} className="view"/>}
            >
                {scrollContent}
            </CScrollbar>
        );
    }
}
```
**`Note:`** While using the customization props(renderTrackHorizontal, renderThumbHorizontal, renderTrackVertical, 
renderThumbVertical,renderView), we will always need to pass through the given props for the respective element like 
in the example above: <div {...props} className="track-horizontal"/>. This is because we need to pass some default 
styles down to the element in order to make the component work.
